Employee record management using MEAN stack

* Use technologies Mongo, Express, AngularJS and Node Js.
* Create a list of 50 employees, so while first time connecting to MongoDB, it will populate these records. ( * Employee First Name, Last Name, Manager Name, Date Of Joining, Education, Work Experience)
* Write REST API using nodejs (getAllEmployees()) and it should check for the authentication.
* Display these 50 employees on the list page with pagination, 15 records each page with checkbox as first column. Use AngularJs.
* User can select randomly employees and export to pdf.
* User can select randomly employees and print the records.
* Provide option to export and print all the records ( i.e. 50 records)
* User can delete the selected record(s).
* Make sure your code runs after download to the computer with only change in the monogodb connection url.
